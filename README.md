# Fake-News-Predictor

This Logistic Regression model is trained on the Kaggle Fake and Trues news titles and their texts. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com

It uses the following packages: numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. 

I used the Tf idVectorizer to give  individual words appeared in the news a score based on their rarity and commonality in True or Fake news titles.
